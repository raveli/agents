Based on the dataset, the investigative data reporter has completed multiple analyses. These are listed below.

## Task
Summarize the most newsworthy data-driven findings from these analyses using up to {} bullet points. Number the bullet points. Note that some analyses may contribute more bullet points than others, which is expected.

Each bullet should reference the relevant analysis number in square brackets. For example: '1. There is a 50% increase in Covid-cases in New York City [5]'.

If multiple analyses yield the same conclusion, include all applicable numbers in the reference.

The summaries should adopt a clear, data-driven, and journalistic style, suitable for a broad audience, without resorting to clichés or emotive language. Clearly articulate the specific findings from the analyses, and refer to specific analyses and findings.

```
CenturyLin showed the most extreme disparities. They offered some customers service of 200 Mbps, amounting to as little as $0.25 per Mbps, but offered others living in the same city only 0.5 Mbps for 400 times as much—$100 per Mbps. [1]
