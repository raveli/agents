Implement these suggestions using the provided dataset right away. Ensure to always provide concrete results based on analysis, not just a plan. DO NOT, in any circumstances, return an hypothetical analysis or a general outline of the steps. Work with what you CAN do. 

Ensure your response is completely clear to someone unfamiliar with your initial analysis, and include any significant findings from previous analyses on this specific question if they still hold after your refined analysis.
